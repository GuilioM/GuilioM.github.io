            <h1>Our Story</h1>
            <p>Kenedi and Guilio’s story began before they were even born. Both Guilio’s mom, Shelley, and Kenedi’s mom, Martha, worked together and in the same department when they were both pregnant for Guilio & Kenedi. There was even a bet going around the office as to who would give birth first. Ultimately, Kenedi won that race as she was born July 08, approximately a week and a half before Guilio entered the world. <br><br></p>
            <p>Guilio and his family moved to Cayo while he was young; whilst Kenedi and her family remained in Belize City. One might think their story would end here, however; fate stepped in multiple times.<br><br></p>
            <p>Guilio made the difficult decision to move back to the city, by himself, to complete his education. Kenedi and Guilio were now both in the city and in the same school. However, as they never really knew each other, again their paths could have never crossed. Fate again had other plans. One of Kenedi’s high school friends had a cousin who also was from Cayo and in an attempt to make her feel welcomed in her new environment, Kenedi’s friends along with this new girl's friends began hanging out. One of these friends was Guilio. They were even in one class together, Precalculus.<br><br></p>
            <p>Kenedi left SJCJC form within a year to go and complete her dream of becoming a doctor…in Costa Rica. Guilio graduated SJCJC and began on his career in IT. Again, this could have been the end for these two, however, as you are reading this story at their wedding, we know fate had other plans once more.<br><br></p>
            <p>When Kenedi came back from Costa Rica, 6 years later, her friends from high school, Marissa and Nicolette, took her back under their arms and she began hanging out with them and their friends, Ritisha and Nina. Ritisha happened to be in a graphic design class in sixth form and was in class with Guilio; they remained friends after all this time. This is how Kenedi and Guilio began their friendship which slowly bloomed over several months; all their friends knew that there was something between them, however, it took them a little bit longer to accept their fate as both were worried about ruining their good friendship.<br><br></p>
            <p>One day when they were hanging out, Guilio made the best decision of both their lives and decided to take the plunge and kiss Kenedi.<br><br></p>
            <!---<p>And well, the rest is history; you are now sitting at their wedding; 3 years, 1 apartment and one furbaby later, waiting patiently for them to walk through the door.<br><br></p>--->
            <p>to be continued...</p>
            <!---<p>We hope you enjoy your night, and we are grateful for you all for being a part of our special day. Thank you for sharing this day with us.<br><br></p>--->
