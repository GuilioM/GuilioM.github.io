            <p>Kenedi and Guilio’s story began before they were even born. Both their moms worked in the same department when they were pregnant for Guilio & Kenedi. There was a bet in the office as to who would give birth first. Ultimately, Kenedi won that race as she was born July 08, 1995, twelve days before Guilio entered the world. <br><br></p>
            <p>Guilio and his family moved to Cayo while he was young; whilst Kenedi and her family remained in Belize City. One might think their story would end here, however; fate stepped in on multiple occasions.<br><br></p>
            <p>Guilio made the difficult decision to move back to the city, by himself, to complete his education at SJCJC, where Kenedi was also studying. As they never really knew each other and had different majors, their paths could have never crossed, however, fate had other plans. As luck would have it, although they were in different majors, they had one class that was common to them, Precalculus, and both happened to take the same class at the same time during the same semester.<br><br></p>
            <p>Kenedi left SJCJC shortly after Precalculus to follow her dream of becoming a doctor…in Costa Rica. Guilio graduated SJCJC and began his career in IT. Again, this could have very well been the end for these two; however, as you are reading this on their wedding website, we know fate had, once again, another plan for these two.<br><br></p>
            <p>When Kenedi returned from Costa Rica, six years later, her friends from high school, Marissa, Nicolette and Nina, welcomed her back with open arms and she began hanging out with their group of friends which included Ritisha. Ritisha happened to be in a graphic design class at SJCJC with Guilio and they had remained friends after. Through their mutual friends, Kenedi and Guilio began their friendship which slowly blossomed over several months. Their family and friends knew that there was something there between them, however, it took them a little bit longer to accept their fate as both were worried about ruining their good friendship. One day, Guilio made the best decision of both their lives and decided to finally take the plunge...<br><br></p>
            <p>…the rest is history. Three years, one apartment, and one furbaby later, their story is only just beginning.  <br><br></p>
            <p>PS: we hope you can share in our continuing story and be a part of our special day.</p>
